## Potential TODOs

- [ ] Dive into [SQLAlchemy tutorials](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/14/) and integrate more features
- [ ] Add [docstrings](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/docstrings) to each function
- [ ] Add [type hinting](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/python-type-hinting)
- [ ] Try creating pagination for the books so you only see 5 books at a time when viewing them
- [ ] Try giving the user options for searching for a book (besides searching by id)
- [ ] Try adding other columns to your database like topic area, difficulty level, number of pages, etc.
